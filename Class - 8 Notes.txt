locating tecniques 

java oop - class, object - oop side 
frameworks - object driven framework - page object model 

TestNG - 

Constructor - 


function - input data, system, output - executes when called
construction - input, system - when an object is created 

test 

test t = new test(); 

if we want to setup any initial value for any properties of the object
we need to create an constructor to setup the value 

facebook - username, password
bankaccount - ssn, email address 
twitter - email 
dmv - vin number, address 

objects - users of the system 

1. constructor exectues with the object creation
2. its not mandatory 
3. no output 

public classname(){

}

So this are tecniques 

problem / requirement 

main method - starting point of our code 

object in the world - 
action
properties 

funtion - how to create and how to use
constructor - how to create and how to use 

Page Object model - 

object is created from the class - class has function and properties
when the object is created - the object is actually a copy of the class

whenever the object is created - you want to do something 

page object model - non-runnable class - store all the functions to find 
web elements 

why we need page object model? - non runnable class - some functions


each web element - one function

object driven framework - seperating web elements from test scripts 
for each web page we should have one page object model class


public webelement getfirstName(){


}

constructor in page object model class is required to make sure
we use the same driver in test scripts and in page object model class

x=3
y=4 

x=y

Setting up TestNG 

1. library file/jar file - 
2. testNG plugin installed with our eclipse 

https://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release/


Select Help / Install New Software...
Enter the update site URL in "Work with:" field:
Update site for release: https://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release/.
Make sure the check box next to URL is checked and click Next.
Eclipse will then guide you through the process.
