Java OOP 

class and object 
class > functions(methods) and properties(global variables)
object is created from a class 
objectname.functionname() 

constructor 
function - parameters(input) - system - return(output) 
static - class 
ovarloading ( function constructo) 
this keyword 
super keyword 
inheritance > how one class is related with another class
overriding 
interface > interface is not a class 
abstract class> what is abstract class and how to use them 
access modifier > public, private, protected, no modifier 

exception and error 




paradigm - 

procedural - non runnable class is regarded as a storage of functions

object oriented programming - object is the implementation of a 
design or a class 

class > non runnable class 

class > design or prototype 

attributes > what it has> data or value > global varaibles, properties
action > what it can do > functions or method 

car class > 
attribute - action 
color, price, numberofdoors, gpsenable, typeofseat, > attribute 
driverfoward, driverback, acceleerate > action 

object is the real car 

properties , functions 





facebook
twitter
bankofamerica
dmvonline portal 


facebook > 
attributes > name, email, password, gender, phone
action > post, chat, edittext, 

global veriable are the properties of the object 

select dd = new select(webelement)

scanner sc = new scanner(sytem.in)


webdriver driver = new chormedriver()

driver.get()
driver.opengooglechrome()

Nothing works outside the project > whatever the access modifer 
does inside the project 

public - inside the package and outside the package, inside>outside the class
private - can only be used inside the class> no usuage in inside or outside
the package
protected - only inside the package 
no modifier - is same as protected - only inside the package 

 

class and object
class > functions and properties 

public void go(){}

public String firstname; 


How to make relationship between classes for designing a system? 

inheritance > properties and functions 
parent > child / parent class , child class

sub class/child class gets all the properties and functions from super class
super class/parent class doesnt get anything from sub class 

bankaccount> checkingaccount> checkingaccountVA


super class and sub class, 

method overriding > if you have same function in parent and child class
child class object must have to use the function from child class


abstract class > can not create an object of that class
how you are going to use functions from that class

bankaccount abstrac class > checking account > checingaccountVA

checkingaccount object can use the function from the bankaccount


interface - is not class 
interface is a class design enforcement > 
in interface no function is implementable 



abstract class








4 key features of OOP > 

abstraction > abstract class
car abstract > go, car c=new car()
subclass sedan > sedan s =new sedan()
s.go
encapsulation> properties and functions in the same class
private 
inheritance > super class .. sub class,, properties and function 
polymorphism > 
go()
go(int x)

car > sedan 

sedan s = new sedan(); 

s is a sedan
s is a car

inheritance > 
parent class > child class

10 web pages 

all these web pages > 30 web elements available in each of the
page > 

10 page object model > 30 functions for each web pages 

selenium/TestNG/cucumber

programming library > 

interface

static > assert
overloading> assert()
webdriver driver=new chromdriver()> interface 
global variable / properties - you can use them inside the function
