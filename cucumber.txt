BDD > behavior driven development 

BDD testing > testing the behvior of the application 

TDD > test driven development > write test case before you start
development 
ATDD > acceptance test driven development > UAT phase, it has to pass
acceptance criterion > test cases before the development

BDD > 
manual testing > test cases as plain english lanugage 
automation testing > test script as programming languaga that only
programmers understand 

BDD > manual test case+ automated test scripts 


BDD > cucumber, jbehave, specflow, eggplant 

Setting up : 

1. plugin for eclipse

in eclipse
Help>eclipse market place > search for cucumber
install cucumber eclipse plugin 

2. set of jar files - cucumber 10/11 jar files 

cobertura-2.1.1
cucumber-core-1.2.4
cucumber-html-0.2.6
cucumber-java-1.2.4

Test Plan vs Test Strategy > 

Test Stragey - highest level doc for testing > QA mansters, CTO
Test plan - a doc after test strategy > qa leads, senior QA> 5+ 
test plans
Release plan > test plan 
Test case - a doc after test plan > validate specific requirements 

Git vs github > git is the technolgy
Git is the version control software 
git commit -m "something"
git push origin master
github is code repository > 

functions > 

public int go(int x, int y){



}


input > sytem > output 
input, argument/parmeter - integer
output, return - no return / no output
sytem, function definition - whatever code 
 we are writing inside the function







cucumber plugin - cucumber editor 

ecilpse + updated jdk > 

eclipse version 2019-6 + jdk 8 / 1.8

updated jdk + most updated eclipse > cucumber plugin 


Cucumber - BDD 

manual test case > qa, bA, developers, managers 
automation script > automation tester understands 

testing the behaviour of the application - 

manual test case - feature file - gherkin keywords to write the features
automated test case - step definition - java 

1 scenario > 1 test case 

test runner - generating report, generating test suite

@BeforeTest
public void setupTest(){

}

feature - given when and then but 

step def - @Given @When @Then

given when and then but 

given the prerequisite - we need to be in the homepage
when - action we are doing 
And
Then - the application behaviour based on the action 
And 

and - multiple when or then 

but - negative result but 





java - selenium > web interaction 

test report, test suite 

TestNG > 
Cucumber> 


buy or lease a car 


java-selenium

open the webpage
click on buy car
you have to seach foryour car
you have click on check eliginbility
fill out the eligibility form 
click on submit
get a response 

@BeforeTest
void setuptest(){

open the webpage
}

@Test
void maintest(){
click on buy car
you have to seach foryour car
you have click on check eliginbility
fill out the eligibility form 
click on submit
get a response 
}


cucumber - feature 
Given user is on the car buying page
when user click on buy
and user submit the eligbilit


Cucumber - BDD 

Feature - one or multiple scenarios - gherkin keywords
given when and then but feature scenerio background example 
file > name.feature
if you have any cucumber plugin installed - template 

jdk - 8 > eclipse 2019-6> cucumber plugin 

1. we can only run feature file , can not run the stepdefinion of java file
2. the test depends on the sequence of how the scenario is sequenced
, it doesnt depend at all on the step def 
3. we can use same step multiple times, but we can not implement
same step multiple time 

feature - scenario - test steps - background 
step def - java file - glue code

how to do data driven testing in cucumber? 

one set of data passed from feature file > 
any amount of sets of data passed from feature file > 

data driven - seperating test data from step definition file 
by creating data table 

object driven - seperating web elements from test scripts(step def) file

how to create a test suite and how to generate test report 

tags - tags are used to run specific scenario from the test runner 

20 feature file - 

want to do something before each feature 
want to do something after each feature 

hooks

@Before
@After

tagged hooks - 

ghekin keywords - 
feature
scneario
