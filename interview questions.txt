Starting testing ..... continue ..... ending 

core process of test case writing and defect tracking 

step 1: getting the requirement and analyze, get access to the application

of the sprint, accomodate with the requirment change

how, whole team is executing the test case, what do you after executing
the test case, pass, how many people are writing test case 
zephry-, ms word, google drive, tfs 
tecebility matrix, how often you execute test case
schedule basis, 
builds - 
test1 , test2 - regression, staging environment 
steps of any test case - ideal number of steps 
integration testing - 
end-to-end testing 

step 4: defect - log the defect - test case failed
reproduce, log the defect - how, assign, fixed-retest, tester

team - how your team managed 

agile-scrum 
meetings - sprint planning, review, retrospective, daily stand up
backlogs - stories - estimation is done 
sprint - 2 weeks - 2 months release - 4 sprint
